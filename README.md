Universal Pokemon Randomizer T
WIP for Typezlocke randomisation

Minor type related options added on UPR ZX by Ajarmar, darkeye, and cleartonic which was based on the Universal Pokemon Randomizer by Dabomstew

# Info

This fork was originally made to make some minor tweaks and fixes, but became a bit more ambitious since 2020. There are several new features and supported games (including 3DS games) compared to the original Universal Pokemon Randomizer.

Have a look at the [release page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases) for changelogs and downloads.

# Bug reports

Refer to Universal Pokemon Randomizer ZX instead, as this at the moment is just our own little experiment.
